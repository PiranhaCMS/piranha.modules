# Modules for Piranha CMS

The idea of this repository is to keep a list of modules and add-ons for Piranha that
people have developed, but also to be a place where you can come with suggestions on
package that you'd like to see developed or maybe find someone to collaborate with.

If you have ideas, thoughts or suggestions, don't hesitate to open an issue.
